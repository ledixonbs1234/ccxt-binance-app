# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the current trading platform into a cohesive, integrated application. The goal is to transform the current disconnected components into a unified platform with three main sections: a homepage displaying cryptocurrency coins, a trading execution page, and a trade testing/backtesting page. The redesign will prioritize using Ant Design for improved aesthetics and user experience.

## Requirements

3. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL provide access to all platform features without requiring re-authentication.
4. WHEN the platform loads THEN the system SHALL use a unified Ant Design theme across all components.
5. WHEN a user interacts with any page THEN the system SHALL provide consistent UI/UX patterns.

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Homepage with Coin Overview

6. WHEN a user wants to search for a specific coin THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality.
7. WHEN viewing the homepage THEN the system SHALL display market trends and highlights.

### Requirement 3: Integrated Trading Execution Page

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a comprehensive trading page where I can analyze charts, place orders, and monitor positions, so that I can execute trades efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the trading page THEN the system SHALL display an interactive price chart for the selected cryptocurrency.
2. WHEN viewing the trading page THEN the system SHALL provide order entry forms for market, limit, and other order types.
3. WHEN a user has open positions THEN the system SHALL display current positions with profit/loss information.
4. WHEN a user wants to apply technical indicators THEN the system SHALL provide options to add various indicators to the chart.
5. WHEN a user places an order THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on order status.
6. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL update chart and order book information in real-time.
7. WHEN a user wants to view order history THEN the system SHALL provide access to historical orders and trades.
8. WHEN a user configures trailing stops THEN the system SHALL integrate the existing smart trailing functionality.

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Trade Testing Environment

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a dedicated environment for testing trading strategies and backtesting, so that I can validate my approaches before risking real capital.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the testing page THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure backtesting parameters.
2. WHEN setting up a backtest THEN the system SHALL allow selection of timeframes, strategies, and risk parameters.
3. WHEN a backtest is running THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators.
4. WHEN a backtest completes THEN the system SHALL present comprehensive results including performance metrics and visualizations.
5. WHEN viewing backtest results THEN the system SHALL allow comparison between different strategies.
6. WHEN a user wants to modify a strategy THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to adjust parameters and rerun tests.
7. WHEN a strategy performs well in testing THEN the system SHALL offer an option to save it for live trading.
8. WHEN a user has multiple saved strategies THEN the system SHALL provide management tools for organizing and comparing them.

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design and Cross-Device Compatibility

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to access the platform from different devices, so that I can monitor and execute trades regardless of my location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform from a desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured interface.
2. WHEN a user accesses the platform from a tablet or mobile device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately.
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL respond with an appropriate layout adjustment.
4. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for common actions.
5. WHEN viewing charts on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL optimize the display for readability.

### Requirement 6: Data Consistency and State Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want consistent data across all platform sections, so that I can make informed decisions based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data updates in one section THEN the system SHALL ensure the same data is updated across all relevant sections.
2. WHEN a user changes settings or preferences THEN the system SHALL persist these changes across sessions.
3. WHEN network connectivity is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully and resynchronize data.
4. WHEN multiple data sources provide conflicting information THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using predefined rules.
5. WHEN a user switches between platform sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the state of user interactions.

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a responsive platform that handles real-time data efficiently, so that I can execute trades without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform displays real-time data THEN the system SHALL update without noticeable lag.
2. WHEN rendering complex charts THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interactions.
3. WHEN processing large datasets for backtesting THEN the system SHALL optimize calculations to complete within reasonable timeframes.
4. WHEN multiple users access the platform simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance standards.
5. WHEN network conditions are suboptimal THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical data transmission.
